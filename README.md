# Yo!🖐🏻 I'm Kage, a 17yo tech-enthusiast 

![◉⁠‿⁠◉](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b8/9f/0a/b89f0a9cc9bdee16902c4be833212223.jpg)

I'm just a confused soul who enjoys tinkering with technology. 
Currently, I'm knee-deep in the world of Arch Linux, trying to navigate its endless possibilities. Despite what you might think, I do have a life...(not really)

**Skills:** Python | JavaScript | HTML | CSS (in the process of learning )


- 👾 I'm constantly learning and evolving, much like a Pokémon, but with less impressive stats.
